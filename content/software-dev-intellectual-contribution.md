Summary: Some musings on whether software development in science is an intellectual contribution.

Yesterday, [a tweet](https://twitter.com/PBarmby/status/590855188161949696) by
[Pauline Bramby](http://www.physics.uwo.ca/~pbarmby/) added some more fuel to a
longer running debate about scientific software development. A number of
bioinformaticians I'm following on twitter were arguing about this in their
blogs and on twitter. I guess it started off with [C. Titus
Brown](https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown)'s blog post about [single use
software](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-how-should-we-think-about-research-software.html).
[Daniel S. Katz](https://twitter.com/danielskatz) responded with [a blog post of
his
own](https://danielskatzblog.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/scientific-software-quality-versus-purpose/),
and [Mick Watson](https://twitter.com/BioMickWatson) [also chimed
in](https://biomickwatson.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/on-publishing-software/).
Before we continue, go read these posts, they're all food for thought.

I [left a dissenting
comment](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-how-should-we-think-about-research-software.html#comment-1977208787)
on Titus' post, mainly in a disagreement on some licensing details, and then
went on to [complain about the high bar Mick was setting for
publication](https://biomickwatson.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/on-publishing-software/#comment-5715)
from a background of publications that weren't focused on software. Arguably,
Mick elegantly excludes those specifically somewhere in his introduction, so I
can actually agree with more of his points for software-centric papers.
My replies were getting kind of long, and so I decided that it was time to write
a proper blog post about this myself.

Then, in reply to Pauline's question on Twitter prompted Titus to [muse about
soft ware as a primary product of
science](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-software-as-a-primary-product-of-science.html).
The comments have some interesting takes on how we're valuating scientific
output in the first place. Daniel came up with a [nice post on what a
primary product of scientific
research](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-software-as-a-primary-product-of-science.html)
could be defined as in the first place. [Konrad
Hinsen](https://twitter.com/khinsen) wrote a [great
comment](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-software-as-a-primary-product-of-science.html#comment-1981392482)
on Titus' post, and then [elaborated in a dedicated blog
post](https://khinsen.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/software-in-scientific-research/).
Again, please go read all of these before continuing any further.

A lot of interesting and valuable material in all these blog posts, don't you
think? Rather than reiterating all of what was said about software being like
telescopes, software being communication and all the other interesting points in
that debate, I want to focus on a new tangent. Software development in science
is often compared to conductiong [experimental
work](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-software-as-a-primary-product-of-science.html#comment-1982263737),
and because most people argue that experimental work is a means to an end, that
is not a primary product of science. So, by analogy, neither should software
development be. The actual _scientific_ contribution is designing the experiment
in the first place. Now, the analogy has one slight problem here, and I'm
tempted to blame that problem on the pretty shoddy practices around software
development in science, people have [written about
this](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/21276/best-practice-models-for-research-code)
before. Mainly, people seem to assume that **implementing** the software is all
there is for software development. I humbly disagree. I would argue that the
analogy with wet lab work would be that **designing experiments** is like
**designing software**, and **conducting experiments** is like **implementing software**.
Now if we follow the general agreement that designing experiments is a valuable
intellectual input to the scientific endeavour, by analogy so should designing
software. So, the answer the question I asked in the topic of the post "Is
software development in science an intellectual contribution?" would be "Yes,
parts of it at least".

Of course Titus asked a slightly different question, and I'm happy to agree that
taken in isolation, software probably is not a product of science. But taken in
isolation, pretty much nothing else is either. Konrad made the same point about
papers. But I think we're looking at the wrong thing here. I would argue that a
good definition of a primary product of science is "it enables further
scientific progress". I think that's what Daniel meant when talking about Nobel
prizes, but maybe aiming for Nobel prizes raises the bar too high. Scientific
progress is incremental, and a good product of science is one that is a solid
stepping stone for the next level of science. Software certainly can be such a
stepping stone.
