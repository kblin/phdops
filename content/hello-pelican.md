Summary: PhDOps blog moved to Pelican on my own domain

After [arguing with a some people](https://xkcd.com/386/) on Twitter recently
about research software quality and suggested bars to publishing that software,
I decided that it probably would be time to dust off the PhDOps blog and start
writing response blog posts, instead of just leaving comments. As the [old
PhDOps blog](https://phdops.blogspot.com) was living on Blogger, I dug out my
login for that and signed on. And then I remembered how painful Blogger makes
everything related to source code. This was one of the reasons I stopped posting
stuff on the PhDOps blog in the first place.

As I really love writing things in Markdown these days, I went and checked what
blogging engines can use that. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) seemed like a
serious contender, but then I realised that it is using ruby, and I'm not
particularly fond of ruby.

Fortunately, there's [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), which is based on Python,
and also seems pretty nice. Also, it's the blogging engine of choice of [C.
Titus "Chuck Norris" Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/).

As I only had to migrate a handful of posts, I just used the good old cut&paste
method, and now all my posts are available on this site as well.

Let's see how many nice posts will happen in future.
