Summary: A new blog to tell the tales from the underfunded cousin of DevOps, while trying to get research done.

Since March 23rd 2013, I've been using
[#PhDOps](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PhDOps) as a tag on twitter for posts
relating to the work I do maintain the antiSMASH web service. As I've been
collecting blog posts that I needed to write about running an academic web
service while having a full time job getting a PhD, I figured this would be a
good name for a blog to collect said posts.  Stay tuned for a post on using
[Docker](http://docker.io/) to deploy [Linux container
(LXC)](http://lxc.sourceforge.net/) based application containers.
